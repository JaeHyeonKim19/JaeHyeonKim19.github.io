### 5.1 Introduction

- Principle of Locality
	- Programs access a small proportion of their address space at any time
	- Temporal locality
		- Items accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon
		- e.g., instructions in a loop, induction variables
	- Spatial locality
		- Items near those accessed recently are likely to be accessed soon
		- e.g., sequential instruction access, array data

- Taking Advantage of Locality
	- Memory hierarchy
	- Store everything on disk
	- Copy recently accessed (and nearby) items from disk to smaller DRAM memory
		- Main memory
	- Copy more recently accessed (and nearby) items from DRAM to smaller SRAM memory
		- Cache memory attached to CPU

- Memory Hierarchy Levels
	![memory-hierachy-levels](./memory-hierarchy-levels.png)
	- Block (aka line): unit of copying
		- May be multiple words
	- If accessed data is present in upper level
		- Hit: access satisfied by upper level
			- Hit ratio: hits/accesses
	- If accessed data is absent
		- Miss: block copied from lower level
			- Time taken: miss penalty
			- Miss ratio: misses/accesses = 1 - hit ratio
		- Then accessed data supplied from upper level

- Characteristics of the Memory Hierarchy

- DRAM Technology
	- Data stored as a charge in a capacitor
		- Single transistor used to access the charge
		- Must periodically be refreshed
			- Read contents and write back
			- Performed on a DRAM "row"

- Advanced DRAM Organization
	- Bits in a DRAM are organized as a rectangular array
		- DRAM accesses an entire row
		- Burst mode: supply successive words from a row with reduced latency
	- Double data rate (DDR) DRAM
		- Transfer on rising and falling clock edges
	- Quad data rate (QDR) DRAM
		- Separate DDR inputs and outputs

- DRAM Generations
	- 시간이 지남에따라 가격은 낮아지고 용량은 증가하였음

- DRAM Performance Factors
	- Row buffer
		- Allows several words to be read and refreshed in parallel
	- Synchronous DRAM
		- Allows for consecutive accesses in bursts without needing to send each address
		- Improves bandwidth
	- DRAM banking
		- Allows simultaneous access to multiple DRAMs
		- Improves bandwidth

- Main Memory Supporting Caches
	- Use DRAMs for main memory
		- Fixed width (e.g., 1 word)
		- Connected by fixed-width clocked bus
			- Bus clock is typically slower than CPU clock
	- Example cache block read
		- 1 bus cycle for address transfer
		- 15 bus cycles per DRAM access
		- 1 bus cycle per data transfer
	- For 4-word block, 1-word-wide DRAM
		- Miss penalty = 1 + 4 * 15 + 4 * 1 = 65 bus cycles
		- Bandwidth = 16 bytes / 65 cycles = 0.25 B/cycle

### 5.2 Memory Technologies

- Review: Major Components of a Comupter
	![review-major-components-of-a-computer](review-major-components-of-a-computer.png)

- Memory Technology
	- Static RAM (SRAM)
		- 0.5ns ~ 2.5ns, $2000 ~ $5000 per GB
	- Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
		- 50ns ~ 70ns, $20 ~ $75 per GB
	- Magnetic disk (HD)
		- 5ms ~ 20ms, $0.20 ~ $2 per GB
	- Ideal memory
		- Access time of SRAM
		- Capacity and cost/GB of disk

- Processor-Memory Performance Gap
	- 프로세서와 메모리의 성능 차이는 시간이 지날수록 양극화되어 왔다.

- The "Memory Wall"
	- Processor vs DRAM speed disparity continues to grow
	![the-memory-wall](./the-memory-wall.png)
	- Good memory hierachy (cache) design is increasingly important to overall performance
